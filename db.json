gateways that I've encountered and one of the trickiest to setup. Now, that I feel quite comfortable with the setup, here's a got through towards a basic setup for your own app. I used laravel at the time, so I'll be telling how to setup braintree in laravel, but it's pretty much similar for other frameworks and languages too. \n\n\n#### Steps to Setup Braintree for your project\n\n  * Signup an  account credentials with [braintree website][braintreesite]. Braintree offers a free sandbox account in which you can do as much testing as you want, which is really cool.\n\n  * Next you will be directed to your dashboard where you can your keys, public key, private key, merchant ID, etc. We'll come to these later.\n\n  * Now go back to your laravel project and add the following to your composer.json file:\n\n    {% codeblock lang:json %}\n    \"require\": {\n      \"braintree/braintree_php\" : \"2.33.0\"\n    }\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n    Or whatever version is latest at the time.\n\n  * And run a composer update from your terminal:\n    {% codeblock lang:bash %}\n    composer update\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n  * Now, include the key file that you got of your sandbox account in the config files. You can create a local folder of your app.php and put all of them in there:\n    {% codeblock lang:php %}\n      'braintree_environment' => '',\n      'braintree_merchantid' => '',\n      'braintree_public_key' => '',\n      'braintree_private_key' => ''\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n  * Now, you are all set to start with braintree. Now open up your controller and write the following to create a client token, which you will need to setup the payment form:\n    {% codeblock lang:php %}\n    $clientToken = Braintree_ClientToken::generate();\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n    And in the client-side you will need to include this with something like this:\n    {% codeblock lang:php %}\n    braintree.setup(\"CLIENT-TOKEN-FROM-SERVER\", \"custom\", {id: \"checkout\"});\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n  * Next, you will need to setup your client-side, i.e. the payment form part. To do that, open up your view file and put in something like this(Of course only the fields that you require. This is only a minimalist example of what you can do with it):\n    {% codeblock lang:html %}\n    <form id=\"checkout\" action=\"/your/server/endpoint\" method=\"post\">\n      <input data-braintree-name=\"number\" value=\"4111111111111111\">\n      <input data-braintree-name=\"cvv\" value=\"100\">\n\n      <input data-braintree-name=\"expiration_date\" value=\"10/20\">\n\n      <!-- you can also split expiration date into two fields -->\n      <input data-braintree-name=\"expiration_month\" value=\"10\">\n      <input data-braintree-name=\"expiration_year\" value=\"2020\">\n\n      <input data-braintree-name=\"postal_code\" value=\"94107\">\n      <input data-braintree-name=\"cardholder_name\" value=\"John Smith\">\n\n      <input type=\"submit\" id=\"submit\" value=\"Pay\">\n    </form>\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n  And the scipt to follow up:\n    \n  {% codeblock lang:js %}\n    client.tokenizeCard({\n      number: \"4111111111111111\",\n      cardholderName: \"John Smith\",\n      // You can use either expirationDate\n      expirationDate: \"10/20\",\n      // or expirationMonth and expirationYear\n      expirationMonth: \"10\",\n      expirationYear: \"2015\",\n      // CVV if required\n      cvv: \"832\",\n      // Address if AVS is on\n      billingAddress: {\n        postalCode: \"94107\"\n      }\n    }, function (err, nonce) {\n      // Send nonce to your server\n    });\n  {% endcodeblock %}\n\n  * Now, when you sent the request to braintree with these data, braintree replies with a payment nounce which you can use to charge the customer. You can do something like this:\n    {% codeblock lang:php %}\n      $result = Braintree_Transaction::sale(array(\n          'amount' => 10,\n          'paymentMethodNonce' => $nounce\n        ));\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n\nNow, that's all that's needed to complete a full payment gateway.\n\n\nSimple enough.

Why is it that people find the traditional editors vim(unix/linux/mac), notepad(windows) uncomfy to work with? Maybe cause for a newbie it’s too complicated. Then comes gnu/emacs and life ain’t any simpler. Well I personally have used Sublime Text and I loved it. A friend suggested to me a year ago, and I’m never getting off it again. But then, what about other users. Why is it that we need to download every time we format our system or buy a new pc. In todays internet era when eveything is on cloud.

Consensus may be defined professionally as an acceptable resolution, one that can be supported, even if not the \"favourite\" of each individual. It is a creative and dynamic way of reaching agreement between all members of a group. Instead of simply voting for an item and having the majority of the group getting their way, a group using consensus is committed to finding solutions that everyone actively supports, or at least can live with. The input and ideas of all participants are gathered and synthesised to arrive at a final decision acceptable to all. Through consensus, we are not only working to achieve better solutions, but also to promote the growth of community and trust. \n\n\n### Consent\n\nGiving consent does not necessarily mean that the proposal being considered is one’s first choice. Group members can vote their consent to a proposal because they choose to cooperate with the direction of the group, rather than insist on their personal preference. Sometimes the vote on a proposal is framed, “Is this proposal something you can live with?” This relaxed threshold for a yes vote can achieve full consent. This full consent, however, does not mean that everyone is in full agreement. Consent must be 'genuine and cannot be obtained by force, duress or fraud. The values of consensus are also not realized if \"consent\" is given because participants are frustrated with the process and wanting to move on.\n\n\n### Sociocracy\n\nIt furthermore paved way to a system of governance using consent decision making and an organisational structure based on cybernetic principles, i.e. a transdisciplinary approach for exploring regulatory systems—their structures, constraints, and possibilities.. It was called Sociocracy.\nSociocracy makes a distinction between \"consent\" and \"consensus\" in order to emphasize that circle decisions are not expected to produce \"a consensus\". It doesn't mean agreement or solidarity. In sociocracy consent is defined as \"no objections,\" and objections are based on one's ability to work toward the aims of the organisation.\nSociocratisch Centrum co-founder Reijmer has summarised the difference as follows: *\"By consensus, I must convince you that I am in the right; by consent, you ask whether you can live with the decision.”*\n\n\n### Consensus Decision Making in Making of a Start-Up\n\nBy now, you must have had a pretty decent understanding on the clarity that consensus decision making can provide us and the advantages of it in a small company or a startup where a few people have to sit-tight in a room and decide over what business model they should go with.\nLet’s go over a model from the emergence of a startup:\n\n 1. Introduce and clarify the issue to be decided.\n\n 2. Explore the issue with your group and look for ideas amongst peers or partners or close friends.\n \n 3. Look for emerging proposal. Sometimes this phase also results in a completely different idea than what was to be decided at all, which is turn deviates a startup from one business model to the next also known as pivot of idea.\n\n 4. Discuss, clarify and amend your proposal.\n\n 5. Test for agreements. Check for blocks, reservations, resolve them if needed and then it’s all good to proceed.\n \n 6. Finally, implement the decision.\n\n\n### Quick Decision Making\n\nHowever, consensus decision making process can be sometimes slower and we are in a cut throat world where multiple issues require our quick attention. In quick consensus we are cutting short the discussion part and paring it down to just one workable proposal with amendments. This is because you are aiming to make the best decision in the time you have. However, this model of decision making needs lots of practice in advance.\nIf you want to use this process, you'll need to discuss in advance the situations when you'll use it, and take time to explore the issues involved. That way you'll already know what people's concerns and reactions might be when confronted with the situation. In effect, this is like having the discussion stage of the consensus process in advance, which will allow you to jump straight to the proposal stage in an urgent situation.\n\n\n### What about on scale?\n\nWe have by now come across multiple models to facilitate consensus decision making in small team or group. But what larger groups? Do we fall back to our democracy system and rely on voting? Well, not really. It’s more challenging to get an unanimous decision in such large group but nonetheless if and when achieved is inspiring in it’s own self.\nThe six steps for reaching consensus are the same as for small groups, but some steps may happen with everyone together and other steps may happen in small groups to enable in-depth discussion and participation.\n\n - **Delegation**: Avoiding micro-management is the key while delegating decisions, where the whole group decides in fine detail what needs to be done.\n - **Large plenaries**: The whole group comes together in one place, can be used to share information, to make proposals and for final decision making.\n - **Working in small groups**: People will be much more comfortable talking openly in a small group of 6-15 people. Working in small groups and teams also saves time. In every organisation the teams are formed for the same reason.\n - **The spokes-council**: Obviously after all that, given the huge size of group, someone has to sit and pass on the judgement and decide over convincing a team to another and make everyone reach one decision.\n\n\nConsensus is about co-operating to find solutions and not competing.

In effect, this is like having the discussion stage of the consensus process in advance, which will allow you to jump straight to the proposal stage in an urgent situation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"What-about-on-scale\"><a href=\"#What-about-on-scale\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What about on scale?\"></a>What about on scale?</h3><p>We have by now come across multiple models to facilitate consensus decision making in small team or group. But what larger groups? Do we fall back to our democracy system and rely on voting? Well, not really. It’s more challenging to get an unanimous decision in such large group but nonetheless if and when achieved is inspiring in it’s own self.<br>The six steps for reaching consensus are the same as for small groups, but some steps may happen with everyone together and other steps may happen in small groups to enable in-depth discussion and participation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Delegation</strong>: Avoiding micro-management is the key while delegating decisions, where the whole group decides in fine detail what needs to be done.</li>\n<li><strong>Large plenaries</strong>: The whole group comes together in one place, can be used to share information, to make proposals and for final decision making.</li>\n<li><strong>Working in small groups</strong>: People will be much more comfortable talking openly in a small group of 6-15 people. Working in small groups and teams also saves time. In every organisation the teams are formed for the same reason.</li>\n<li><strong>The spokes-council</strong>: Obviously after all that, given the huge size of group, someone has to sit and pass on the judgement and decide over convincing a team to another and make everyone reach one decision.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consensus is about co-operating to find solutions and not competing. An extremely effective decision making process which has advantages beyond expectations and I personally feel every organisation should adhere part of it or completely to it. </p>\n"},{"title":"Intro to Python!","subtitle":"The Zen of Python","date":"2014-08-28T18:30:00.000Z","_content":"{% img http://i.imgur.com/lcwFbRx.png [5rem] [auto] [Intro to Python [Intro to Python]] %}\nPython is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.

We will be using Monolog to serve our purpose.\n\n#### Steps to setup laravel logs in papertrail:\n\n  + Install Monolog using composer: \n{% codeblock %}\ncomposer require monolog/monolog\n{% endcodeblock %}\n\n  + Replace the code in app/start/global.php : \n{% codeblock %}\n$monolog = Log::getMonolog();\n$monolog->pushHandler(new Monolog\\Handler\\SyslogHandler('keyword'));\n{% endcodeblock %}\n    \nKeyword can be set to whatever we want. And in the papertrail log system it will show up as a program of such name.\n\nAnd we are all set to go.\n\n---\n\nNow, suppose you want to setup email notifications too. Who has time to go through all the logs and then view all the boring 404 errors on the papertrail events. Event though it is simple. Pun intended ;) So, papertrail knows how lazy a programmer can get. You set up a search alert. And configure to deliver mails on all the logs at a regular interval of time. Generally, it's better to put up as a 24 hour notice, hence pointing out the clear distribution time to check the logs just before sleep. \n\n#### Now, to set-up alerts,\n\n1. Go to your Events page, where all the logs are being shown. Search something. Probably by some keyword or some program name or anything random you wish for.\n2. Click on Save your search and then choose to configure it.\n3. You will be redirected to a new page where you can set your alert via various services. Choose any one of them and you are set.\n4. If you want email notifications, click on Email and enter the email addresses you want the logs to go to. You can feed in multiple emails also by separating with a comma(,).\n5. Choose what interval you wish for and start your alert system.\n\nTo test if the alarm works, just Click on Test mode button, which send mail to the email ids provided of the saved search.\n\nTa da! A full setup of papertrail is now complete.\n\n---\n\n\nYou can do plenty more with papertrail.. Keep digging..

However, it took roughly a year to spread across platforms and other boundaries. Now, if we look into the google apps like GMail, YouTube, Google Drive, Google Keep etc., we will be finding nothing but material design. It's interesting though how a simple elevation in a structure can create the sense of it's nearness or how the ripple effect on clicking, can bring the sense of realtime interaction to an object to life.\n\n### Design\n\nSo, before we know more about Material Design, let's talk about what we actually mean by design. Design is the art of considered creation. It is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object or a system (as in architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams and sewing patterns).\n\n### Material Design\n\nA material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion. The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n\n### Material Design for Mobile\n\nMaterial design can be implemented in mobile devices with an ease that overwhelmed the design world, taking it by a storm. Soon, Google launched a new theme based on material design called it [material theme][material_theme]. Material Theme pulls out a whole new world to the mobile design world, which provides an extensive guide to advanced animations, drawables, icons, lists and cards, etc. iOS could not stood by watched. [Material Kit][material_kit] is a iOS library providing access to the material designs and similar animations that [google material theme][material_theme] provides.\n\n### Web Components\n\nMaterial design is not limited to mobile designs. Google started the [polymer project][polymer_project] to provide the same components for material design components out to the world of web as well. However there are non-google libraries which provides similar components as well. [Materialize Css][materializecss] is one my personal favorites. It provides light weight stylesheets to provide increadible components for the web. [Material Design for Angular JS][angular_material] is also another incredible library providing support for Angular framework. For all the [react][react] fans, there is [material ui][react_polymer]. There are other amazing libraries whcih can be used for this matter.\n\n### Getting Started\n\nThe easiest way to get started with material design would be to start with [material design lite][md_lite]. Material Design Lite lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your websites. It doesn’t rely on any JavaScript frameworks and aims to optimize for cross-device use, gracefully degrade in older browsers, and offer an experience that is immediately accessible. It also provides a customizable [css theme builder][lite_css_theme] where you can pick up your primary and secondary colors and it lets you download the new theme.\n\nSo, if you like design methodology and exploring around different design standards, this is good place to play around.\n\nFeel free to explore and revert back with any doubts/queries that you might face.\n\n\n\n[google_io]: https://www.google.com/events/io/io14videos/79edef8b-96d4-e311-b297-00155d5066d7\n[material_theme]: https://developer.android.com/design/material/index.html\n[material_kit]: https://github.com/nghialv/MaterialKit\n[polymer_project]: https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/\n[materializecss]: http://materializecss.com/\n[angular_material]: https://material.angularjs.org/latest/#/\n[react_polymer]: http://material-ui.com/#/\n[react]: http://facebook.github.io/react/\n[md_lite]: http://www.getmdl.io/\n[lite_css_theme]: http://www.getmdl.io/customize/index.html\n","source":"_posts/introduction-to-material-design.md","raw":"---\ntitle:  \"Introduction to Material Design\"\nsubtitle: \"Paper for the web\"\ndate:   2015-07-12\ncategories:\n - design\ntags:\n - material\n - design\n - theme\n - lite\n - angular\n - react\n - paper\n---\n### Introduction\n\nMaterial Design was first introduced in [Google I/O 2014][google_io].

However, it took roughly a year to spread across platforms and other boundaries. Now, if we look into the google apps like GMail, YouTube, Google Drive, Google Keep etc., we will be finding nothing but material design. It’s interesting though how a simple elevation in a structure can create the sense of it’s nearness or how the ripple effect on clicking, can bring the sense of realtime interaction to an object to life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Design\"><a href=\"#Design\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Design\"></a>Design</h3><p>So, before we know more about Material Design, let’s talk about what we actually mean by design. Design is the art of considered creation. It is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object or a system (as in architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams and sewing patterns).</p>\n<h3 id=\"Material-Design\"><a href=\"#Material-Design\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Material Design\"></a>Material Design</h3><p>A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion. The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Material-Design-for-Mobile\"><a href=\"#Material-Design-for-Mobile\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Material Design for Mobile\"></a>Material Design for Mobile</h3><p>Material design can be implemented in mobile devices with an ease that overwhelmed the design world, taking it by a storm. Soon, Google launched a new theme based on material design called it <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/design/material/index.html\">material theme</a>. Material Theme pulls out a whole new world to the mobile design world, which provides an extensive guide to advanced animations, drawables, icons, lists and cards, etc. iOS could not stood by watched. <a href=\"https://github.com/nghialv/MaterialKit\">Material Kit</a> is a iOS library providing access to the material designs and similar animations that <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/design/material/index.html\">google material theme</a> provides.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Web-Components\"><a href=\"#Web-Components\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Web Components\"></a>Web Components</h3><p>Material design is not limited to mobile designs. Google started the <a href=\"https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/\">polymer project</a> to provide the same components for material design components out to the world of web as well. However there are non-google libraries which provides similar components as well. <a href=\"http://materializecss.com/\">Materialize Css</a> is one my personal favorites. It provides light weight stylesheets to provide increadible components for the web. <a href=\"https://material.angularjs.org/latest/#/\">Material Design for Angular JS</a> is also another incredible library providing support for Angular framework. For all the <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/react/\">react</a> fans, there is <a href=\"http://material-ui.com/#/\">material ui</a>. There are other amazing libraries whcih can be used for this matter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Getting-Started\"><a href=\"#Getting-Started\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Getting Started\"></a>Getting Started</h3><p>The easiest way to get started with material design would be to start with <a href=\"http://www.getmdl.io/\">material design lite</a>. Material Design Lite lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your websites. It doesn’t rely on any JavaScript frameworks and aims to optimize for cross-device use, gracefully degrade in older browsers, and offer an experience that is immediately accessible. It also provides a customizable <a href=\"http://www.getmdl.io/customize/index.html\">css theme builder</a> where you can pick up your primary and secondary colors and it lets you download the new
