Integration on Laravel","subtitle":"A payment gateway now made even simpler to use","date":"2014-12-21T18:30:00.000Z","_content":"### A payment gateway now made even simpler to use\n\n[Braintree][braintreesite] is one of the easiest payment gateways that I've encountered and one of the trickiest to setup. Now, that I feel quite comfortable with the setup, here's a got through towards a basic setup for your own app. I used laravel at the time, so I'll be telling how to setup braintree in laravel, but it's pretty much similar for other frameworks and languages too. \n\n\n#### Steps to Setup Braintree for your project\n\n  * Signup an  account credentials with [braintree website][braintreesite]. Braintree offers a free sandbox account in which you can do as much testing as you want, which is really cool.\n\n  * Next you will be directed to your dashboard where you can your keys, public key, private key, merchant ID, etc. We'll come to these later.\n\n  * Now go back to your laravel project and add the following to your composer.json file:\n\n    {% codeblock lang:json %}\n    \"require\": {\n      \"braintree/braintree_php\" : \"2.33.0\"\n    }\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n    Or whatever version is latest at the time.\n\n  * And run a composer update from your terminal:\n    {% codeblock lang:bash %}\n    composer update\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n  * Now, include the key file that you got of your sandbox account in the config files. You can create a local folder of your app.php and put all of them in there:\n    {% codeblock lang:php %}\n      'braintree_environment' => '',\n      'braintree_merchantid' => '',\n      'braintree_public_key' => '',\n      'braintree_private_key' => ''\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n  * Now, you are all set to start with braintree. Now open up your controller and write the following to create a client token, which you will need to setup the payment form:\n    {% codeblock lang:php %}\n    $clientToken = Braintree_ClientToken::generate();\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n    And in the client-side you will need to include this with something like this:\n    {% codeblock lang:php %}\n    braintree.setup(\"CLIENT-TOKEN-FROM-SERVER\", \"custom\", {id: \"checkout\"});\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n  * Next, you will need to setup your client-side, i.e. the payment form part. To do that, open up your view file and put in something like this(Of course only the fields that you require. This is only a minimalist example of what you can do with it):\n    {% codeblock lang:html %}\n    <form id=\"checkout\" action=\"/your/server/endpoint\" method=\"post\">\n      <input data-braintree-name=\"number\" value=\"4111111111111111\">\n      <input data-braintree-name=\"cvv\" value=\"100\">\n\n      <input data-braintree-name=\"expiration_date\" value=\"10/20\">\n\n      <!-- you can also split expiration date into two fields -->\n      <input data-braintree-name=\"expiration_month\" value=\"10\">\n      <input data-braintree-name=\"expiration_year\" value=\"2020\">\n\n      <input data-braintree-name=\"postal_code\" value=\"94107\">\n      <input data-braintree-name=\"cardholder_name\" value=\"John Smith\">\n\n      <input type=\"submit\" id=\"submit\" value=\"Pay\">\n    </form>\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n  And the scipt to follow up:\n    \n  {% codeblock lang:js %}\n    client.tokenizeCard({\n      number: \"4111111111111111\",\n      cardholderName: \"John Smith\",\n      // You can use either expirationDate\n      expirationDate: \"10/20\",\n      // or expirationMonth and expirationYear\n      expirationMonth: \"10\",\n      expirationYear: \"2015\",\n      // CVV if required\n      cvv: \"832\",\n      // Address if AVS is on\n      billingAddress: {\n        postalCode: \"94107\"\n      }\n    }, function (err, nonce) {\n      // Send nonce to your server\n    });\n  {% endcodeblock %}\n\n  * Now, when you sent the request to braintree with these data, braintree replies with a payment nounce which you can use to charge the customer. You can do something like this:\n    {% codeblock lang:php %}\n      $result = Braintree_Transaction::sale(array(\n          'amount' => 10,\n          'paymentMethodNonce' => $nounce\n        ));\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n\nNow, that's all that's needed to complete a full payment gateway.\n\n\nSimple enough.

Now, that I feel quite comfortable with the setup, here's a got through towards a basic setup for your own app. I used laravel at the time, so I'll be telling how to setup braintree in laravel, but it's pretty much similar for other frameworks and languages too. \n\n\n#### Steps to Setup Braintree for your project\n\n  * Signup an  account credentials with [braintree website][braintreesite]. Braintree offers a free sandbox account in which you can do as much testing as you want, which is really cool.\n\n  * Next you will be directed to your dashboard where you can your keys, public key, private key, merchant ID, etc. We'll come to these later.\n\n  * Now go back to your laravel project and add the following to your composer.json file:\n\n    {% codeblock lang:json %}\n    \"require\": {\n      \"braintree/braintree_php\" : \"2.33.0\"\n    }\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n    Or whatever version is latest at the time.\n\n  * And run a composer update from your terminal:\n    {% codeblock lang:bash %}\n    composer update\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n  * Now, include the key file that you got of your sandbox account in the config files. You can create a local folder of your app.php and put all of them in there:\n    {% codeblock lang:php %}\n      'braintree_environment' => '',\n      'braintree_merchantid' => '',\n      'braintree_public_key' => '',\n      'braintree_private_key' => ''\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n  * Now, you are all set to start with braintree. Now open up your controller and write the following to create a client token, which you will need to setup the payment form:\n    {% codeblock lang:php %}\n    $clientToken = Braintree_ClientToken::generate();\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n    And in the client-side you will need to include this with something like this:\n    {% codeblock lang:php %}\n    braintree.setup(\"CLIENT-TOKEN-FROM-SERVER\", \"custom\", {id: \"checkout\"});\n    {% endcodeblock %}\n\n  * Next, you will need to setup your client-side, i.e. the payment form part.

However, it took roughly a year to spread across platforms and other boundaries. Now, if we look into the google apps like GMail, YouTube, Google Drive, Google Keep etc., we will be finding nothing but material design. It's interesting though how a simple elevation in a structure can create the sense of it's nearness or how the ripple effect on clicking, can bring the sense of realtime interaction to an object to life.\n\n### Design\n\nSo, before we know more about Material Design, let's talk about what we actually mean by design. Design is the art of considered creation. It is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object or a system (as in architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams and sewing patterns).\n\n### Material Design\n\nA material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion. The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n\n### Material Design for Mobile\n\nMaterial design can be implemented in mobile devices with an ease that overwhelmed the design world, taking it by a storm. Soon, Google launched a new theme based on material design called it [material theme][material_theme]. Material Theme pulls out a whole new world to the mobile design world, which provides an extensive guide to advanced animations, drawables, icons, lists and cards, etc. iOS could not stood by watched. [Material Kit][material_kit] is a iOS library providing access to the material designs and similar animations that [google material theme][material_theme] provides.\n\n### Web Components\n\nMaterial design is not limited to mobile designs. Google started the [polymer project][polymer_project] to provide the same components for material design components out to the world of web as well. However there are non-google libraries which provides similar components as well. [Materialize Css][materializecss] is one my personal favorites. It provides light weight stylesheets to provide increadible components for the web. [Material Design for Angular JS][angular_material] is also another incredible library providing support for Angular framework. For all the [react][react] fans, there is [material ui][react_polymer]. There are other amazing libraries whcih can be used for this matter.\n\n### Getting Started\n\nThe easiest way to get started with material design would be to start with [material design lite][md_lite]. Material Design Lite lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your websites. It doesn’t rely on any JavaScript frameworks and aims to optimize for cross-device use, gracefully degrade in older browsers, and offer an experience that is immediately accessible. It also provides a customizable [css theme builder][lite_css_theme] where you can pick up your primary and secondary colors and it lets you download the new theme.\n\nSo, if you like design methodology and exploring around different design standards, this is good place to play around.\n\nFeel free to explore and revert back with any doubts/queries that you might face.\n\n\n\n[google_io]: https://www.google.com/events/io/io14videos/79edef8b-96d4-e311-b297-00155d5066d7\n[material_theme]: https://developer.android.com/design/material/index.html\n[material_kit]: https://github.com/nghialv/MaterialKit\n[polymer_project]: https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/\n[materializecss]: http://materializecss.com/\n[angular_material]: https://material.angularjs.org/latest/#/\n[react_polymer]: http://material-ui.com/#/\n[react]: http://facebook.github.io/react/\n[md_lite]: http://www.getmdl.io/\n[lite_css_theme]: http://www.getmdl.io/customize/index.html\n","source":"_posts/introduction-to-material-design.md","raw":"---\ntitle:  \"Introduction to Material Design\"\nsubtitle: \"Paper for the web\"\ndate:   2015-07-12\ncategories:\n - design\n---\n### Introduction\n\nMaterial Design was first introduced in [Google I/O 2014][google_io].
